# Creating the Python environment
To leverage the resources provided in this repository it's first recommended to create a python virtual environment. 

## Why Use Virtual Python Environments?
Using a virtual environment is crucial for managing dependencies in Python projects. It helps to:
- **Avoid Conflicts**: Different projects may require different versions of the same package. Virtual environments keep dependencies isolated.
- **Ensure Reproducibility**: When sharing your project, others can install the same versions of dependencies you used.
- **Maintain a Clean Global Environment**: Prevent clutter in your global Python installation by installing packages only in the virtual environment.

## Different Ways to Create Virtual Environments
There are several ways to create and manage virtual environments in Python:

1. **Using `venv` (Native Python)**: Lightweight and included in Python 3.3 and later.  
   - Documentation: [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

2. **Using `virtualenv`**: A widely-used external tool, compatible with Python 2 and older versions of Python 3.  
   - Documentation: [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

3. **Using `conda`**: An environment manager provided by Anaconda. Suitable for managing Python and non-Python dependencies.  
   - Documentation: [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

4. **Using `pipenv`**: Combines `pip` and `virtualenv` for better dependency management.  
   - Documentation: [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

## Step-by-Step Guide: Using the Native Python Way (`venv`)

### Prerequisites

- Ensure Python 3.3 or later is installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**  
   Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where your project is located:  
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
    Run the following command to create a virtual environment named env:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    ```
    This will create a directory called env containing the virtual environment files.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    On Windows:
    ```bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
    On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
     ```
    After activation, your terminal prompt will show (env) indicating the virtual environment is active.

    4. **Install Dependencies**
    Use the requirements.txt that is available at the root of the repository and install all the needed libraries like this:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
# Specific libraries for chapter 5

## Spacy model download
In chapter 5 (listings 5.5 and 5.6) we leverage the spacy library, but to make it work properly we need first to download the en_core_web_sm model. Please run the command below
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
## Installing Tesseract
We leverage Tesseract on the listing 5.10 and 5.11, but this library must also be installed beforehand.

* Windows
  * Download: Download the installer from the official [Tesseract website](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
  * Installation:
      * Run the installer.
      * Choose the installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR).
      * Select the desired language data to install (e.g., English, German, etc.).
      * Complete the installation.
  * Environment Variable:
      * Add the installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR) to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run Tesseract commands from any command prompt.
* Mac
  * Install Homebrew (if not already installed) by running in a terminal:
    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
  * Install Tesseract with Homebrew:
    ```
    brew install tesseract
    ```
  * Install language data:
    ```
    brew install tesseract-lang/data/eng
    ```
* Linux
  * Update package lists in a terminal: 
      ```
      sudo apt update
      ```
   * Install Tesseract and language data: 
      ```
      sudo apt install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng 
      ```
**Note:** Verify Installation by Opening a terminal or command prompt and running:
```
tesseract --version
```
# Leveraging Google AI
In **chapter 8** we'll use Google AI in the code to illustrate the book's topics.
These are the steps to get ready:
* Obtaining a Google Key
* Creating the GEMINI_KEY environment variable
## Obtaining a Google AI Studio API Key
1. Access to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in by using your Google Account
3. Create an API Key: 
   * Navigate to API Keys: Locate the section for API keys or credentials within Google AI Studio. As of today it's a simple button avaialbe on the top left.
   * Create a New Key: Follow the provided instructions to generate a new API key.
   * Restrict the Key (Optional): Enhance security by restricting key usage:
        * Application Restrictions: Specify the allowed websites or applications.
        * IP Address Restrictions: Limit usage to specific IP addresses or ranges.
4. Copy the Key: Carefully copy the generated API key. Treat it like a password!

*Important Notes*
* Security: 
   * Never hardcode the API key directly in your code. Utilize secure storage methods like environment variables or secrets management.
   * Regularly rotate API keys to minimize the risk of compromise.
* Usage Limits: Be aware of any usage limits or quotas associated with your API key.
**Disclaimer: This information is for general guidance. Always refer to the [official Google AI Studio documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) for the most up-to-date and accurate instructions.**

## Creating the GEMINI_KEY environment variable
1. Access System Properties:
    * Windows: Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start Menu.
        Right-click "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties". Go to "Advanced system settings" and click "Environment Variables".
    * macOS/Linux: Open your terminal.
2. Create a New Variable:
    * Windows: In the "System variables" section, click "New".
        * Enter the Variable name: GEMINI_KEY.
        * Enter the Variable value (your actual API key you've created beforehand).
        * Click "OK" to save.
    * macOS/Linux:
        Use the following command in the terminal:
         ```
         export GEMINI_KEY="your_actual_api_key" 
         ```

This sets the variable for the current terminal session. To make it persistent, add this line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc).
