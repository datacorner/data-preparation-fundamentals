It took about 20 minutes from the start of the line to actually orderingIt was surprising to find Howlin' Ray's in the middle of Chinatown in LA but at least it was near some familiar shops. I was tempted to get the spiciest sandwich but got a mild sando to be safe. I could've probably handled a hotter sandwich but it was still good. The chicken was crunchy but juicy and there was a really nice depth of flavor because of the spices. \\u00c2\\u00a0The sandwich is also a moderate size.There wasn't much space to sit besides a bench outside the shop. No seating is inside. Most people seem to take there orders to go.I would come back if I was nearby again. Wish there were more locations but I can always call ahead next time to order.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"StarRating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.31275292476243244,\n        \"min\": 3.5,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.4,\n          4.3,\n          4.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Price\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"$$\",\n          \"$$$\",\n          \"$$$$\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Sentiment analysis with VADER"],"metadata":{"id":"KDUxfXS95Z2G"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","from nltk.wsd import lesk\n","from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n","\n","nltk.download('vader_lexicon')\n","sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() #A: Initialize the VADER sentiment analyzer\n","\n","def analyze_sentiment(comment): #B:  Define a function to get sentiment based on the comment\n","    scores = sia.polarity_scores(comment)\n","    if scores['compound'] >= 0.05:\n","        return \"Positive\"\n","    elif scores['compound'] <= -0.05:\n","        return \"Negative\"\n","    else:\n","        return \"Neutral\"\n","\n","#C: Apply the function to the 'Comment' column and create a new column 'Sentiment'\n","df['vader_Sentiment'] = df['Comment'].apply(analyze_sentiment)\n","\n","df[['Comment', 'vader_Sentiment', 'StarRating']] #D: Display the DataFrame with the new Sentiment column"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":460},"id":"_UFrJjqu3pji","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730278672245,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2782,"user":{"displayName":"Benoît Cayla","userId":"16127805405482571098"}},"outputId":"c9a6d468-f80d-4146-e827-f5b7fef25de2"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package vader_lexicon to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package vader_lexicon is already up-to-date!\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                Comment vader_Sentiment  \\\n","0     Great ambiance indoors and attentive staff.

It took about 20 minutes from the start of the line to actually orderingIt was surprising to find Howlin' Ray's in the middle of Chinatown in LA but at least it was near some familiar shops. I was tempted to get the spiciest sandwich but got a mild sando to be safe. I could've probably handled a hotter sandwich but it was still good. The chicken was crunchy but juicy and there was a really nice depth of flavor because of the spices. \\u00c2\\u00a0The sandwich is also a moderate size.There wasn't much space to sit besides a bench outside the shop. No seating is inside. Most people seem to take there orders to go.I would come back if I was nearby again.
