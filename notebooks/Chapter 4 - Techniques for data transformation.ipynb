at the chart, a few key conclusions can be drawn:\n","\n","### 1. **Peak in 2012**:\n","   - There is a massive spike in reviews in 2012, which could suggest that there was a significant event or release of highly anticipated games during that year. This is an outlier compared to other years.\n","   \n","### 2. **Fluctuations Over Time**:\n","   - The number of reviews fluctuates significantly from year to year. Some years, like 2015 and 2017, also show higher review numbers compared to others, though not as extreme as 2012.\n","   - There are also years with very few reviews, such as 2010, 2011, and 2023, indicating either fewer game releases or less popular games during those years.\n","\n","### 3. **Decline in Recent Years**:\n","   - From 2018 onward, the total number of reviews seems to decline gradually, with very low numbers in 2021 and 2023.\n","   - 2024 shows a slight recovery but is still relatively low compared to earlier years.\n","\n","### Possible Explanations:\n","   - **Industry Trends**: The spike in 2012 might indicate a peak period in the gaming industry, followed by periods of lower activity or less engagement from users.\n","   - **Consumer Behavior**: The fluctuating review numbers could be influenced by shifts in consumer preferences, such as the rise of mobile gaming or a shift towards digital platforms that aren't represented in the data.\n","   - **Major Releases**: Certain years could have seen the release of blockbuster games that generated a lot of reviews (like 2012), while other years may not have had such notable titles.\n","   - **Pandemic Influence**: The drop in 2021 and low levels in 2022 may reflect disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting game development, releases, and consumer interaction.\n","\n","### Further Exploration:\n","   - Investigate the major game releases or industry events that correspond to the years with high and low review counts.\n","   - Consider looking at the trends for specific genres or platforms to see if the fluctuations are concentrated in certain segments of the market.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OrDQgsto22Ru"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_agg_rev = df_valve_mp.groupby([\"overall_player_rating\", \"Year\"])[\"totalreviews\"].sum().reset_index()\n","df_agg_rev.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":226},"id":"rLR4jQDPsMDX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728021662358,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Benoît Cayla","userId":"16127805405482571098"}},"outputId":"da1e6d82-f401-4f8d-b223-393599b14668"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["  overall_player_rating  Year  totalreviews\n","0              Negative  2022         37789\n","1              Negative  2023         10974\n","2               Neutral  2017       2432683\n","3               Neutral  2020        948818\n","4               Neutral  2021         66369"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-213ffa79-bdc7-454a-9516-385135a6e455\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>overall_player_rating</th>\n","      <th>Year</th>\n","      <th>totalreviews</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Negative</td>\n","      <td>2022</td>\n","      <td>37789</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Negative</td>\n","      <td>2023</td>\n","      <td>10974</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Neutral</td>\n","      <td>2017</td>\n","      <td>2432683</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Neutral</td>\n","      <td>2020</td>\n","      <td>948818</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Neutral</td>\n","      <td>2021</td>\n","      <td>66369</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-213ffa79-bdc7-454a-9516-385135a6e455')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-213ffa79-bdc7-454a-9516-385135a6e455 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
